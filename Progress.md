Got dotenv working using: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-dotenv

Did not get https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-config working. Also used https://medium.com/armenotech/configure-environment-variables-with-react-native-config-for-ios-and-android-7079c0842d8b

Started this:

> List the features I want to have. Organized by type: (insulin/pump/cartridge/etc., dexcom/sensor/transmitter/etc., exercise, etc. ). Then by description of what needs to be recorded, then by questions that need to be asked when recording this information.

Done with this. However did not (yet) add helpful comments:

> Clean up each file.

> Remove superfluous lines of code, comments, etc.

> Remove commented out code, superfluous console.log()'s, and the like. Add helpful comments.

> Use `React_Native_cleanup` as a branch name.

Done with this.

> Determine which branch has the following files the most up-to-date,

> the `NextSteps.md`, `Progress.md`, `README.md`, and `ToDo.md` files.

> The `React_Native_feature_list` branch or the `React_Native_cleanup` branch.

> Then merge those files into the `React_Native` branch.

> And then into the `dev` branch.

> And then into the `main` branch.

Got it working. See the `./Data-Logging-App/ReactNative/README.md` file.

Modified the code a bit.

Connected it to Airtable ~~and/or a Google Drive spreadsheet~~.

Started updating one or both of those from the app.
