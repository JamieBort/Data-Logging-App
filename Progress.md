Got dotenv working using: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-dotenv

Did not get https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-config working. Also used https://medium.com/armenotech/configure-environment-variables-with-react-native-config-for-ios-and-android-7079c0842d8b

Started this:

> List the features I want to have. Organized by type: (insulin/pump/cartridge/etc., dexcom/sensor/transmitter/etc., exercise, etc. ). Then by description of what needs to be recorded, then by questions that need to be asked when recording this information.

Done with this. However did not (yet) add helpful comments:

> Clean up each file.

> Remove superfluous lines of code, comments, etc.

> Remove commented out code, superfluous console.log()'s, and the like. Add helpful comments.

> Use `React_Native_cleanup` as a branch name.

Done with this.

> Determine which branch has the following files the most up-to-date,

> the `NextSteps.md`, `Progress.md`, `README.md`, and `ToDo.md` files.

> The `React_Native_feature_list` branch or the `React_Native_cleanup` branch.

> Then merge those files into the `React_Native` branch.

> And then into the `dev` branch.

> And then into the `main` branch.

Done with this.

> Delete

> - the `React_Native_cleanup_backup` branch,

> - the `./copy_FeatureList.js` file,

> - the `./Data.js` file,

> - and the `./PostEventComponent.js` file.

Done with this.

> Address the `The git repository at has too many active changes, only a subset of Git features will be enabled.` issue VS Code is giving me with this repo.

> See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60160453/vs-code-the-git-repository-has-too-many-active-changes-only-a-subset-of-git-f

> The easiest "solution" might be to just re-clone the repo.

> Re-cloning the repo will address this issue.

Done with this.

> Look into restructuring the app:

> Moving all the components into a components directory.

> Determine whether I want to move the api calls to other file(s). A API call resource: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-native-networking-api-requests-using-fetchapi/

> And https://www.waldo.com/blog/react-native-project-structure

> ~~Come back to the `React_Native_cleanup` branch for this.~~

> Use the `React_Native_restructure` branch for this. Create it if it does not already exist. Come back to it if it does.

> Check to make sure everything is in order. Then merge the `React_Native_restructure` branch into the `React_Native` branch.

Done with this.

> Finish adding all my wanted features to the `DATA_OBJECT` object in the `./ReactNative/data-logging-app/FeatureList.js` file.

> Come back to the `React_Native_feature_list` branch for this.

Got it working. See the `./Data-Logging-App/ReactNative/README.md` file.

Modified the code a bit.

Connected it to Airtable ~~and/or a Google Drive spreadsheet~~.

Started updating one or both of those from the app.
