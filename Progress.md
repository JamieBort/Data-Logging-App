Got dotenv working using: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-dotenv

Did not get https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-config working. Also used https://medium.com/armenotech/configure-environment-variables-with-react-native-config-for-ios-and-android-7079c0842d8b

Started this:

> List the features I want to have. Organized by type: (insulin/pump/cartridge/etc., dexcom/sensor/transmitter/etc., exercise, etc. ). Then by description of what needs to be recorded, then by questions that need to be asked when recording this information.
