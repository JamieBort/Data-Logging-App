# ToDo.md

1. Update the steps in the `./Data-Logging-App/ReactNative/README.md` file. Make sure to include a reference to `expo start --tunnel`. And https://trello.com/c/bRzPaKks/1366-expo-catchall-for-learning-directory

2. When the `React_Native` branch is ready to be merged into the `dev` branch, move the `./Data-Logging-App/ReactNative/data-logging-app` directory into the `./Data-Logging-App/` directory. (or the `./` directory.)

3. If I ever use the `Angular`, `Svelte_Native`, or `Vue` branches, make sure to remove the following directories that do not correspond: `angular-tour-of-heroes/`, `ReactNative/`, `Svelte/`, and/or `Vue/`.
