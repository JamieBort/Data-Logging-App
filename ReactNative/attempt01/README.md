# attempt01/

following this https://www.tutorialspoint.com/react_native/react_native_environment_setup.htm tutorial

I thought I had `react-native` installed. But when I ran `create-react-native-app MyReactNative`:

`/Data-Logging-App/ReactNative/attempt01$ create-react-native-app MyReactNative`

I received this

`-bash: create-react-native-app: command not found`

error.
