# attempt02/

following this https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=quickstart documentation.

I ran this `npx create-expo-app AwesomeProject` command.

```
cd AwesomeProject
npx expo start
```

and

```
cd AwesomeProject
expo start
```

also works.

But I am having trouble with Split Tunneling via my VPN.

Waiting to hear back from their tech support.

To start this with Expo, run `npx expo start`.

NOTE: `./ReactNative/attempt02/AwesomeProject/android/` and `./ReactNative/attempt02/AwesomeProject/android/local.properties` are not used.
