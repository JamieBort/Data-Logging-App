# NextSteps

The next things that need to be accomplished, in order, based on the list found in the `ToDo.md` file.

## Next Steps

1. List the features I want to have. Organized by type: (insulin/pump/cartridge/etc., dexcom/sensor/transmitter/etc., exercise, etc. ). Then by description of what needs to be recorded, then by questions that need to be asked when recording this information.

2. Finish adding all my wanted features to the `DATA_OBJECT` object in the `./ReactNative/data-logging-app/FeatureList.js` file.

3. Clean up the `./ReactNative/data-logging-app/FeatureList.js` file. Remove commented out code, superfluous console.log()'s, and the like. Add helpful comments.
